# Diablo-Loot-Generator

Implemented procedural content generation algorithm in Java used for role-playing game Diablo II with mapping data structures and recursion.

The format of the output is:

Fighting `<monster name>`...

You have slain `<monster name>`!

`<monster name>` dropped:

`<complete item name>`

`<base item statistic>`

`<additional affix statistics>`

Then it will prompt the following:

Fight again [y/n]? `<echoed user input from Scanner>`

That's it, have fun playing it!
